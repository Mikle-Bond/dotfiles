# .dotfiles

My dotfiles repository, designed to be used with GNU Stow.
It resides in the `$HOME/.dotfiles`.

### Programs kit

- Stow (ðŸ‘“)
- urxvt
- vim + Vundle + Airline
- YouCompleteMe
- i3wm (purely trough .xinitrc)

##### TODOs

- [ ] Add links to external projects for quick access
- [ ] Check how it works on other machines
- [ ] Write scripts for managing new dotfiles (probably using rsync)
- [ ] Figure out what to do with system configs
