# .dotfiles

My dotfiles repository, designed to be used with GNU Stow.
It resides in the `$HOME/.dotfiles`.

### Programs kit

- Stow (ðŸ‘“)
- urxvt
- vim + Vundle + Airline
- YouCompleteMe
- i3wm (purely trough .xinitrc)
- compton
- pass
- acpilight

##### TODOs

- [ ] Add links to external projects for quick access
- [ ] Check how it works on other machines
- [x] Write scripts for managing new dotfiles (probably using rsync) (stow/dev/scripts/dot-get.sh)
- [ ] Figure out what to do with system configs
- [ ] Make `bash` config absolute from other packages
- [ ] Clean up `compton*` configs.
- [ ] Make shure .gitingores' are present where needed (qutebrowser, ranger, etc)
- [ ] Come up with 3rd-party plugins/scripts management (ranger, mpv, vim, etc)
